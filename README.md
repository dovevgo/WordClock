# WordClock
Arduino Based Word Clock

I have used [ESP 8266 D1 Mini Lite](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DeDKktV) and [FASTLED WS2812B Strip](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DnlV0UT) for this project.
The clock got 8 lines, where each line is 9 leads. 

If you use a different size of leds strip, then you might need to adjust the words leds settings.
